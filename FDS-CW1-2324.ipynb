    "Please remember the University requirement as regards all assessed work for credit.  Details about this can be found at: [http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/admin/policies/academic-misconduct](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/admin/policies/academic-misconduct)\n",

It is also not permitted to discuss this coursework on Piazza. The only exception is that if you believe there is an error in the coursework, you may ask a private question to the instructors, and if we feel that the issue is justified, we will send out an announcement.\n",

    "\n",
    "- This coursework counts for 20% of the marks of Foundations of Data Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The coursework is designed to assess the following course Learning Outcomes: \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Describe and apply good practices for storing, manipulating, summarising, and visualising data.\n",
    "    2. Use standard packages and tools for data analysis and describing this analysis, such as Python and LaTeX.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is marked based on the PDF export from a Jupyter notebook (see __General instructions__ below), which you are to submit via Gradescope (see __Assessment/Assignment Submission/Coursework 1 - Data wrangling and visualisation__ folder in Learn).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The assignment is marked out of 100 and the number of points is indicated by each question. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We will assess your work on the following criteria:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - functional code that\n",
    "    (a) performs the computations asked for, as measured by verifying some of the numeric outputs from your processing and reading your code if there is doubt about what you have done and\n",
    "    (b) is clear and makes good use of Pandas functions\n",
    "    \n",
    "  - the quality of the visualisations, measured against the _Visualisation principles and guidance_ handout used in the [S1 Week 5 workshop](https://opencourse.inf.ed.ac.uk/inf2-fds/course-materials/semester-1/week-5/workshop) \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - the quality of your textual comments - as measured by how accurate, clear, complete and insightful they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## General instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read the instructions carefully, answering what is required. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Read through all of a question before starting, as some parts build on each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to understand the meaning the datasets, you may need to follow the links citing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fill in your answers in the cells indicated. You may delete text like \"Your answer to Q1.2 goes here\". __Do not edit or delete any other cells.__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you have finished a question, use a Jupyter notebook server to export your PDF, by selecting __File→Download as→PDF via LaTeX (.pdf)__. Check this PDF document looks as you expect it to. If changes are needed, update the notebook and export again.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We ask for multiple types of responses:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Numeric responses, which we will use to verify that the processing has been done correctly.\n",
    "  2. Visualisations, which will be assessed using the parts of the _Visualisation principles and guidance_ PDF that apply to the visualisation in question.\n",
    "  3. Comments on your findings, which may ask you to describe, explain or interpret your results, and which may ask you to reflect on your design choices. These comments will be assessed on how accurate, complete and insightful they are. \n",
    "  \n",
    "- Keep your answers brief and concise - in the PDF output, textual answers should remain inside the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For answers involving numerical values, use correct units where appropriate and format floating point values to a reasonable number of decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For answers involving visualisations:\n",
    "  - Make sure to label the visualisations clearly and provide titles, and legends where necessary, as per the Visualisation guidelines.\n",
    "  - All visualisations have to fit on one page. For example, 3 graphs on 3 separate pages counts as 3 visualisations; We would only mark one of these 3 visualisations.\n",
    "  - \"One visualisation\" could  be a figure with multiple subplots, for example created using the using the matplotlib subplot and grid system.\n",
    "  - Creating plots in separate code cells that appear on the same page is not recommended. We may consider both plots as one visualisation, but mark you down for it. At worst we may only mark one visualisation.\n",
    "  - Please follow the guidance on font size in the _Visualisation Principles and Guidance_, i.e. a real font size of 8 points at a minimum. We instruct the markers to view all submissions at the same magnification and not to zoom in, to give a fair comparison between students.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We strongly recommend restarting the kernel and running all (__Kernel→Restart & Run all__) from time to time, to test your code works properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you have finished all the questions, submit the final PDF using the submission instructions in the __Assessment→Assignment Submission→Coursework 1 - Data wrangling and visualisation__ folder in Learn Ultra. __Please allow enough time to upload your PDF before the deadline.__\n",
    "\n",
    "## How long should I spend on this coursework?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have designed the coursework to take around 8 hours for a student who has completed the lab sessions, attended the lectures and workshops and done the comprehension questions. There will be some spread around this value, but if you're up-to-date with the course, and you're taking much longer than 8 hours (say 12 hours), then you might want to consider how many marks you are gaining for each extra hour of work.\n",

In addition, data from death registrations ([Deaths dataset](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/unintentional-injuries/resource/89807e07-fc5f-4b5e-a077-e4cf59491139)), obtained from the National Records of Scotland up to and including the calendar year 2022, adds valuable insights into the severity and consequences of these incidents.

We'll combine this data with another relevant dataset in Question 4 to gain a more comprehensive understanding. Through a set of questions and data manipulation tasks, we will create meaningful visualisations and perform trend analysis to identify patterns that might help injury prevention. The questions are organised so that the first few questions give more detailed instructions and the later questions are more open-ended.

Finally, the datasets used in this notebook are not large enough to cause issues, but do consider computational complexity and efficiency of your code.\n",
